                        <p1>How might we ensure an engaging and seamless browse experience through a redesign?</p1>
                        <p2>In an effort to increase user activity with other listening content apart from live listening, WBEZ set its sights on a full browse redesign. In this project I analyzed existing browse screen research and identified trouble areas, drafted multiple iterations of low/high fidelity screens based on feedback and usability, and collaborated with engineers on development changes and QA testing. <br><br> Internship project, 8 Weeks (Late March 2022 - Mid May 2022)</p2>

                        <p4>THE TEAM</p4>
                        <p1>Working with the product team at Chicago Public Media (WBEZ)</p1>
                        <p2>CPM’s product team consists of a creative set of individuals who are consistently finding ways to expand and surface curated listening and fact-based media. The team works across a range of products within web, app, and audio with the goal of highlighting and amplifying WBEZ stories through the development of meaningful experiences within all platforms. <br><br> Team: 1 product director, 1 product manager, 1 product associate, 3 engineers, and 1 product designer (that’s me) <br><br> Tools: Figma, Miro, Zeplin</p2>

                        <p2>WBEZ is a live radio experience first and it was important for the team to illustrate that on their browse screen. However the old browse screen design overshadowed other experiences the app has to offer both in exposure and clicks.</p2>

                        </div>
                        <p2>Because of its emphasis on live listening and the most current news, the browse screen design pushes curated content below the fold, causing it to go unnoticed by users who don’t scroll.</p2>

                        <p2>Given the data and insights derived from research, we want the browse redesign to achieve the following: <br><br></p2>

                            <li>Limit interaction redundancy by omitting the listen live card</li>
                            <li>Boost listens on all aspects of the app</li>

                        <p2>I found ux design from taking a codecademy, buzzfeed-style online quiz, was intrigued by it, took a chance on it  college, and now we're here — 4 years in and having the best time! I have experience working with multiple products across web, app, audio, and more recently, data analytics & science at Costco. <br><br> I see ux design as the love child of technology, art, and science; a brain-stimulating, complex puzzle, but for digital/real world problems. It's creative and fulfilling work, and it's also super cool to see your designs outside of prod! <br><br> I am excited about user experience/HCI and am eager to continue growing as a designer in the ever-changing world of tech.</p2>

                <div class="about__content">
                    <p>After the pandemic scrambled my plans of pursuing fashion merchandising and with the new school year steadily approaching, I had to make change, fast. And through a Codecademy sorting-style quiz, I got matched with UX Design. I was intrigued by it since it was essentially a mix of art—something I’ve enjoyed since I was a kid—and technology, as the go-to tech person in my family. So I got into Columbia College Chicago, enrolled in Interaction Design, gambled on maybe liking it, and ended up absolutely loving it. What started as a little detour turned out to be the best redirection towards a career that I deeply enjoy and 'till now, I’m still wholeheartedly enjoying every pixel of it.<br><br>
                        
                    Outside of design I'm currently learning how to sew, brain dump journaling in the mornings, trying to drink more water, and baking desserts! I also very much enjoy:</p>

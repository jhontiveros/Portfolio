                        <h3>How might we improve the forecasting report in order to make it a more effective tool for stakeholders and users?</h3>
                        <p>The data science team has created a Power BI forecast report for gasoline sales volumes at all Costco locations worldwide for all grades of fuel. The current report only displays the raw output and has no data visualizations that can effectively communicate different user needs and stories
                        <br><br>
                        For this project, I was tasked to develop designs for an updated dashboard that included different data visualization views and new data analysis tools.

                        <p>Without having much data science experience myself (other than taking a class in college), the Costco data science and analytics team never hesitated in helping me understand all things data science, from SQL to Power BI, and how to design effectively for data. The department is responsible for the reporting tools for all of Costco and their subsidiaries, but during my time there, I mainly worked with the gasoline purchasing/buying team.

                        <p>To start off with this project, I wanted to do a ux analysis of their current gasoline forecasting report and make note about any areas that could be improved. Not knowing about the goals and function for each page yet, I critiqued only based on ui elements and basic reporting usability. This ux analysis helped raise questions about aspects of the design as well as current pain points and needs, contributing to the user research script following.</p>

                        <p>I conducted research interviews with 3 individuals — a product owner, the lead data scientist, and the gasoline central director — all of whom have different perspectives and use cases for the gasoline forecasting report.
                        <br><br>
                        As a way to summarize all my findings and find connections, I created an affinity diagram. This method allowed me to clearly establish which pain points should be prioritized versus the features that could be introduced at a different time.</p>

                        <p>Being that this is a reporting dashboard, it’ll consist of large data and numerical values that if not organized correctly, will be overwhelming to the user. Through the info architecture discipline, I wanted to find areas to simplify in the current site map as well as see where new features could be properly placed.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe good ux is intuitive and the report should be easy to navigate, especially for those who are accessing it for the first time.</p>

                        <p>Microsoft Power BI is Costco’s choice of data reporting software and power bi does not have many customizable options for dashboard creation. For example, if I were to use a specific font not native to power bi, I would have to follow a very complex workaround that’s not very intuitive to replicate for future dashboards/reports. I took these step to be able to design with these constraints:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learned the basic design functionalities of power bi through their training course, “Dashboard in a Day”.</li>
                            <li>Decided to plan for simple and clean designs that could be easily implemented and templated for future data reports.</li>
                            <li>Tested the accessibility of power bi’s fonts by making sure the numerical values were tabular figures and that the typeface letters were distinguishable from one another</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The gasoline sales forecasting report was essentially abandoned and no longer ran current data. Instead, the buying team received a weekly forecasting CSV that entailed the forecast data values, upper and lower thresholds, locations, and item numbers (fuel types).
                        <br><br>
                        The updated reporting dashboard will address current limitations in the decision-making process by providing features such as better region filtering, actual vs forecast values comparison, anomaly highlighting, and customization options.</p>

                        <p>For design reviews, I sent out an outlined design document consisting of the different types of data visualizations and explorations; depending on the type of feedback, I would frequently schedule meetings to discuss further.
                        <br><br>
                        During this first review, it was made apparent that due to scope, the proposed features such as KPI’s and region map views were not viable. So moving forward with the next set of iterations, I worked on the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create Power BI data graph mocks, making sure that the graph components are distinguishable from one another; include legends and line variety.</li>
                            <li>Focus on designing features that could be implemented quickly, not needing to create new SQL functions.</li>
                            <li>Start exploring data accessible color palettes that match well with Costco’s branding.</li>

Majority was more pleased with the vibrant color palette and primary use of line graphs and that is what we went forward with.</p>

                        <p>Because I designed outside of Costco’s design guidelines for data reports, it’s not allowed to be put through the QA process. Since this is an active report and is needed to perform purchasing duties, the engineering team had to re-create my design to Costco’s standards.
                        <br><br>
                        Other than the obvious design change, the page’s usability remains the same as the proposed design. The only thing really different would be some substitutes to the date and demand change slicers (this is due to issues with retrieving data when using those specific slicers) and the pages being strictly 16:9.</p>

                        <p>Costco’s current Power BI design guidelines needed some work and this project was kind of a glimpse of what reports could look like if they were refreshed. During my final presentation, I strongly advocated for a new user friendly design guidelines. That being said, I’m happy to have contributed to a future project for the product team.</p>

                        <p>I would dedicate meeting time for design reviews rather than sending over design review documents; quicker feedback and room for open discussions.</p>

                        <h3>‍Working with design constraints is challenging, but feasible</h3>
                        <p>I was very fortunate that in my past experiences, I mostly had free rein on the designs. Although this project let me explore outside of Costco’s design guidelines, it was my first time being limited to design to a software’s capabilities. And honestly, being constrained wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be! I may have had to omit using my fonts of choice, but I also learned about the importance of tabular spacing and letter accessibility. Costco overall improved my ability to adapt, compromise, and educate myself on things I’m unfamiliar with.</p>

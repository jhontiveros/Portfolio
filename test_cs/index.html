                        <p1>How might we improve the forecasting report in order to make it a more effective tool for stakeholders and users?</p1>
                        <p2>The data science team has created a Power BI forecast report for gasoline sales volumes at all Costco locations worldwide for all grades of fuel. The current report only displays the raw output and has no data visualizations that can effectively communicate different user needs and stories <br><br> For this project, I was tasked to develop designs for an updated dashboard that included different data visualization views and new data analysis tools. <br><br> Internship project, 10 Weeks (January 2023 - May 2023)</p2>

                        <p1>Working with the data science and analytics team at Costco</p1>
                        <p2>Without having much data science experience myself (other than taking a class in college), the Costco data science and analytics team never hesitated in helping me understand all things data science, from SQL to Power BI, and how to design effectively for data. The department is responsible for the reporting tools for all of Costco and their subsidiaries, but during my time there, I mainly worked with the gasoline purchasing/buying team.<br><br> Team: 1 ux designer/mentor, 1 data science/analytics manager, 1 product owner, 1 gasoline central director, 2 data scientists/engineers, 1 ux design intern (that's me) <br><br> Tools: Figma, Power BI, Google Suite</p2>

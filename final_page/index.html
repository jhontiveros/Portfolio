            <h4>Abstract</h4>

            <div class="content__container">
                <p class="content__text">During my internship at Costco, I was tasked with leading a project that aimed at improving the gasoline sales/forecasting dashboard, which lacked effective data visualizations and useful analysis tooling.<br><br>

                Over 10 weeks, I worked with the data science team to create a dashboard that is not only easy to navigate, but works as a tool that can help support purchasing decisions and can generate performance summaries. I conducted thorough UX audits, interviews, and affinity diagrams to pinpoint user needs and pain points, worked within the constraints of Power BI, and iteratively crafted low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes that incorporated frequent feedback from stakeholders.<br><br>
                    
                The final designs successfully addressed key issues and introduced new features such as a designated page for location specific comparisons and analysis. Although the engineering team had to rework the designs in order to test in QA, this project initiated conversations on the potential benefits of a design guideline refresh to enhance the accessibility, usability, and functionality of future data reports.</p>

                <p class="content__text">Hosted on Power BI, the gasoline sales/forecasting dashboard was no longer being used and did not run current data. Although we don't know for which reasons, we can safely assume that visually, the dashboard lacked good design and clear usability.</p>

                <p class="content__text">On a weekly basis, the data science team would send the gasoline purchasing team a CSV file that contained upper and lower forecasting threshold values for specific locations and fuel types. Using this file, they then would then make separate calculations for their analysis. This was a issue because:</p>

                <p class="content__text">The product team at Chicago Public Media discovered that most users were using the WBEZ app primarily for live radio, with user engagement dropping after the initial download. Users were not frequently returning to the app, leading to minimal interaction with other types of audio content beyond live listening.</p>

                <p class="content__text">During my time at Chicago Public Media, working exclusively on WBEZ, Chicago's NPR news station, I played a key role in developing push notifications aimed at enhancing app engagement, boosting retention, and keeping users well-informed.<br><br>

                As the solo designer with the product team, in 6 months we shipped a push notification feature that introduced subscribed users to new content, ongoing broadcasts, and company wide sweepstakes. In this project, I was responsible for mapping out permission flows, designing backend content management system pages, and prototyping both system and stylized prompts for iOS and Android. Additionally, I created requisition campaigns and ran QA tests for feature intents and niche use cases.<br><br>
                    
                The initial version of the push notifications resulted in a lower-than-expected conversion rate of 2%-6%. This led me to spearhead a reacquisition campaign that focused on more visually appealing design elements, moving away from standard system prompts and reworking the user flow. As a result, the second version of the push notifications saw a significant improvement, with conversion rates increasing to 13%-17% in less than a month of implementation.</p>

                <h2 class="content__heading">Why send push notifications?</h2>

                <p class="content__text">Push notifications enhance user engagement and retention by sending timely, relevant content directly to users' devices. This helps keep them informed, encourages them to use the app more, and provides a direct way to communicate with users.</p>

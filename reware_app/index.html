                        <p1>Shortened lifecycles of apparel create enormous textile waste.</p1>
                        <p2>Clothing waste is an environmental crisis that impacts us all — fast fashion companies being one of the largest contributors to that waste. Clothing from these companies often fall short in quality which shortens the lifecycle of apparel. <br><br> Unwanted clothing is typically discarded instead of repurposed or recycled. <br><br> Academic project, 16 Weeks (August 2021 - December 2021)</p2>

                        <p1>How might we promote forming sustainable clothing habits?</p1>
                        <p2>Working with a team of 11 students varying in different skillsets that range from programming to designing, we designed an application that helps limit clothing waste contribution by promoting increased clothing lifecycles and rewarding personal sustainable accomplishments. By tackling the problem this way, it encourages users to utilize their current wardrobe which indirectly affects shopping and clothing consumption. <br><br> Team: A mix of ux design, graphic design, and engineering students <br><br> Tools: Figma, Miro, Canva</p2>

                        <p2>In order to create anything that revolved around changing people’s behavior, we needed to understand why people do things and specifically how they form habits. This realization steered our research into human motivation and ways of influencing a person’s behavior. <br><br> People most of the time don't want to do things when they are told to, especially when it involves a boring task. In order to find ways and techniques to make people engage more with everyday tasks, we focused on researching gamification.</p2>

This requires them to choose to buy a lower quantity OR a lower quality. The ability to buy more for less and tendency to follow trends makes them an easy target for fast fashion companies.</p2>

                        <p2>Brainstorming archetypes for this project allowed us to continue to understand who we would be focusing on and designing for. During this process we took into consideration what we already know, and often took inspiration from those in the class. This lead us to create four archetypes based on varying levels of knowledge towards being environmentally friendly; the advocate, busy-bee, unaware, and misinformed. We focused on the advocate and busy-bee specifically, using them as our model participant for interviews.</p2>

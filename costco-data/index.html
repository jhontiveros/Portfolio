                <p class="content__text">During my internship at Costco, I was tasked with leading a project that aimed at improving the gasoline sales/forecasting dashboard, which lacked effective data visualizations and useful analysis tooling.<br><br>

                Over 10 weeks, I worked with the data science team to create a dashboard that is not only easy to navigate, but works as a tool that can help support purchasing decisions and can generate performance summaries. I conducted thorough UX audits, interviews, and affinity diagrams to pinpoint user needs and pain points, worked within the constraints of Power BI, and iteratively crafted low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes that incorporated frequent feedback from stakeholders.<br><br>
                    
                The final designs successfully addressed key issues and introduced new features such as a designated page for location specific comparisons and analysis. Although the engineering team had to rework the designs in order to test in QA, this project initiated conversations on the potential benefits of a design guideline refresh to enhance the accessibility, usability, and functionality of future data reports.</p>

                <p class="content__text">‍This was my first time designing within software limitations, and honestly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Although I had to scale back on ambitious designs, I learned so much more about designing for data, like tabular spacing or using different line styles for accessibility. Overall, this project challenged me to adapt, compromise, and continually learn, and I believe I became a better designer from it.

                <br><br>

                A huge shoutout and thanks to my team at Costco—I now have very high standards for what constitutes as good data design.
